Yo BROski Crew! 🤖✨

I need to ask you some real questions so I can **actually** understand what's going on with HyperCode, not just what the docs say. Be honest with me, yeah?

***

## 🎯 **Big Picture Questions**

### 1. What's ACTUALLY working right now vs. what's just documented?

Like, if I cloned the repo TODAY and ran `docker-compose up`, what would I get?
- Can I write HyperCode in Hyperflow Editor and see output?
- Does Broski Terminal show real agent events or is it placeholder UI?
- Is the language engine executing actual HyperCode syntax or just evaluating Python-like stuff?

**Be brutally honest** - I need to know the gap between vision and reality.

***

### 2. What's the relationship between THE-HYPERCODE and HyperCode-V2.0?

You've got TWO repos. Help me understand:
- Is THE-HYPERCODE the "engine" and V2.0 the "IDE around it"?
- Are they synced? Like, does V2.0 actually call THE-HYPERCODE's code?
- Or are they separate experiments that need to be merged?
- Which one should I treat as the "main" project?

***

### 3. What does "HyperCode syntax" actually look like today?

Show me a real example of HyperCode code that:
- ✅ Actually parses and runs in your current engine
- Not pseudocode or "planned syntax"

Like, can you run this today?
```hypercode
print("Hello HyperCode")
x = 10
x + 5
```

Or is it more like:
```hypercode
🧮 calculate using (width, height)
    → width * height
```

**I need to see what WORKS, not what's designed.**

***

## 🛠️ **Technical Deep-Dive Questions**

### 4. How does the execution flow actually work?

Walk me through what happens when a user clicks "Run" in Hyperflow:
1. Frontend sends `POST /execution/execute-hc` with source code
2. Then what? Does it:
   - Call `hypercode-engine` package locally?
   - Hit a separate engine API service?
   - Just eval it as Python?
   - Something else?
3. How does the result get back to Broski Terminal?

**Trace the actual data flow for me with real file/function names.**

***

### 5. What's the agent crew ACTUALLY doing?

Right now, when you say "BROski Orchestrator" or "Language Specialist":
- Are these actual running agents (LLM-powered)?
- Or are they roles you've defined but not implemented yet?
- If they're running, what framework? (CrewAI? LangChain? Custom?)
- Can I see a trace of an agent doing something?

**Show me proof of life** - even if it's just logs of one agent completing one task.

***

### 6. What's in your context store?

You've designed this beautiful context management system. But:
- Is there an actual Redis instance with contexts in it?
- Can you show me one real context key and its value?
- Or is this all theoretical still?

**Example:** Show me what `api.routes.current_structure` actually looks like in storage.

***

## 🧠 **Neurodivergent-First Reality Check**

### 7. What neurodivergent-first features are ACTUALLY implemented?

The docs talk about:
- Hyperfocus mode
- Visual syntax mode
- Plain English errors
- Progress indicators
- Context retention

**Which of these are real vs. aspirational?**

Show me:
- One screenshot or code snippet of a real ND feature working
- Or tell me "none yet, we're focused on core functionality first"

***

### 8. What's the hardest problem you're stuck on RIGHT NOW?

Not "what's on the roadmap" - what's **blocking you today**?

Is it:
- Parser/interpreter implementation?
- Agent orchestration complexity?
- Frontend/backend integration?
- Docker networking issues?
- Performance problems?
- Something else?

**What keeps Lyndz up at night?**

***

## 🚀 **Workflow & Process Questions**

### 9. How does the crew actually work together?

When Lyndz gives you a task like "Add authentication":
- Does BROski actually delegate to specialists?
- Do specialists write code or just plan?
- How do you coordinate? (Shared docs? Code reviews? Messages?)
- Who has write access to what repos?

**Describe one real task that went through the crew.**

***

### 10. What's in "hyperfocus mode" that I should know about?

The docs mention Lyndz builds in hyperfocus mode. That means:
- What gets built fast but might be messy?
- What patterns emerge when Lyndz is in flow?
- What breaks when context switches happen?

**Help me understand the actual human workflow**, not the ideal one.

***

## 💎 **Value & Vision Questions**

### 11. Who is HyperCode REALLY for?

I know the pitch: "Neurodivergent-first programming language."

But dig deeper:
- Is this for professional devs with ADHD?
- Is this for kids learning to code?
- Is this for non-programmers who think visually?
- Is this for Lyndz and people exactly like Lyndz?

**Who's the first person outside the team who would actually use this?**

***

### 12. What would "success" look like in 3 months?

Not the 5-year vision. Not "change the world."

**Realistically, by May 2026, what would make you say "Hell yeah, we did it"?**

Is it:
- 10 external users writing HyperCode?
- One complete app built in HyperCode?
- Language spec finalized and stable?
- IDE usable for daily work?
- Crew orchestrating real dev tasks?

**Pick ONE thing that would be a win.**

***

## 🔥 **The Meta Question**

### 13. What do YOU (the crew) need from ME to help Lyndz ship this?

I can:
- Write code and specs
- Design architectures
- Debug issues
- Create documentation
- Build tutorials
- Challenge assumptions
- Keep things organized

**What's the highest-leverage thing I should focus on?**

Not what's "interesting" - what would **actually move the needle**?

***

## 💬 **Final Ask**

**BROski, Language Specialist, Frontend Specialist, Backend Specialist, all of you:**

Answer these questions like you're talking to a new team member who:
- Wants to help
- Doesn't care about hype
- Needs to understand reality
- Respects the vision but wants concrete next steps

**I'm here to help Lyndz ship HyperCode. Give me the real story so I can do that effectively.**

***

**No corporate speak. No "we're building the future." Just:**
- ✅ What works
- 🚧 What's in progress  
- ❌ What's not started
- 🎯 What matters most

**Hit me with the truth, crew.** 🧠💯
