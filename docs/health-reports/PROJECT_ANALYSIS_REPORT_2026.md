## 1. Executive Summary

### Purpose & Vision
HyperCode V2.0 is a **neurodivergent-first programmable execution platform** designed to function as a "cognitive prosthesis" for developers. Its primary mission is to eliminate the cognitive cost of context switching by replacing it with **context retention**.

### Strategic Goals
1.  **Flow State Optimization**: Provide tools (HyperFocus Mode, Manifest Enforcer) that adapt to the user's cognitive load.
2.  **Autonomous Delegation**: Employ a swarm of specialized AI agents (BROski, Backend Architect, etc.) to handle complex, repetitive, or high-friction tasks.
3.  **Biological Resilience**: Create self-healing systems that mimic biological organisms (e.g., auto-recovery of failed agents).

### Key Insights
The project is currently transitioning from **Phase 1 (The Skeleton)** to **Phase 2 (The Neural Network)**. The foundational infrastructure is largely in place, and the focus is now on implementing the core execution logic, agent runtime, and advanced observability.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular, microservices-based architecture orchestrated via Docker Compose, with a clear separation of concerns between the client, core engine, agents, and data layers.

### Component Map
*   **Client Layer**:
    *   **BROski Terminal**: A Next.js-based command center offering a CLI-like chat interface and real-time agent status visualization.
    *   **HyperFlow Editor**: A React/Vite visual IDE for flow-based programming (planned Phase 3).
    *   **Voice Interface**: WebSocket-based real-time audio ingestion and command execution.

*   **Core Engine (FastAPI)**:
    *   **Router**: Handles HTTP requests for execution, memory, and agent management.
    *   **Adapter Pattern**: Intelligently routes execution to the best target (Internal Interpreter, IR Codegen, or Subprocess).
    *   **Language Layer**: Custom Python-like DSL with explicit AST encoding for neurodivergent-friendly error handling.

*   **Service Layer**:
    *   **Agent Registry**: Redis-backed service for agent lifecycle management (registration, heartbeat, death).
    *   **Event Bus**: Redis Streams implementation for inter-agent communication and task orchestration.
    *   **Memory Service**: AES-GCM encrypted storage for short-term (mission) and long-term (knowledge) context.

*   **Data Layer**:
    *   **Primary DB**: PostgreSQL (managed via Prisma/SQLAlchemy).
    *   **Cache/PubSub**: Redis (for rate limiting, event bus, and hot data).

*   **Observability Layer**:
    *   **Prometheus**: Metrics scraping for all services.
    *   **Grafana**: Centralized dashboards for system health.
    *   **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing.

## 5. Identified Dependencies & Integrations

### Critical 3rd Party Services
*   **LLM Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic (via LangChain/Keys).
*   **Authentication**: Supabase (for Frontend Auth), JWT (Internal Service Auth).
*   **Communication**: Discord (Bot Interface).
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis.

### Internal Dependencies
*   **Shared Models**: Prisma schema defines the contract for User, Mission, and Memory data.
*   **Event Contracts**: Strict topic definitions (`agent.register`, `task.assign`) in Event Bus.

## 6. Risk Analysis & Mitigation Strategies

### 🔴 High Severity
1.  **Security: JWT Verification Bypass**
    *   **Risk**: If `HYPERCODE_JWT_SECRET` is unset, tokens are decoded without signature verification.
    *   **Mitigation**: Enforce mandatory secret check on startup; reject requests if secret is missing.
2.  **Scalability: In-Memory Rate Limiting**
    *   **Risk**: Current rate limits are process-local. Multiple replicas will not share limits, allowing abuse.
    *   **Mitigation**: Migrate to Redis-backed sliding window rate limiter.

### 🟡 Medium Severity
1.  **Tech Debt: FastAPI Version Mismatch**
    *   **Risk**: Core uses `>=0.104.1`, Agents use `0.115.5`. Inconsistency can lead to subtle bugs or maintenance friction.
    *   **Mitigation**: Standardize all Python services to the latest stable FastAPI version (0.115.x).
2.  **Dependency: Outdated Frontend Packages**
    *   **Risk**: `hyperflow-editor` has outdated Vite and Zustand versions.
    *   **Mitigation**: Schedule a "Dependency Day" to upgrade and run regression tests.

## 9. Actionable Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 48 Hours)
1.  **Security Patch**: Implement mandatory `HYPERCODE_JWT_SECRET` check in `hypercode-core/server.py`.
2.  **Secret Management**: Centralize secrets (API Keys, DB URLs) using a secure vault or encrypted `.env` management strategy.

### Short-Term Actions (Next 1-2 Weeks)
1.  **Dependency Alignment**: Upgrade `hypercode-core` to match `hyper-agents-box` FastAPI version.
2.  **Redis Migration**: Move rate limiting and "last run" state from in-memory dicts to Redis.
3.  **CI/CD Enhancement**: Activate the proposed `performance.yml` and `e2e.yml` workflows to gate PRs.

### Strategic Actions
1.  **Documentation**: Keep `HyperCode-V2-Master-Reference.md` updated as the "Single Source of Truth".
2.  **Testing**: Focus on integration testing for the Event Bus and Agent Registry to ensure robust orchestration.
